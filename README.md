## Overview
Many people like shopping but the main problem is the time take for the billing. We like to solve this problem.
In this case, we like to introduce a device that can do all billing work so that there is no need to wait for billing. they can buy things and pay themselves.

## Problems
-Long waiting queues
-Safety and health during a pandemic
-Lot of labour for scanning and billing process
-Increased budget
-Forget to buy products
-Waste time on searching products
-Difficult to display offers
